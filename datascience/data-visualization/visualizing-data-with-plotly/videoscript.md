**Narrator (Voiceover):**  
"Welcome to this lesson on **Visualizing Data with Plotly**! In the previous lesson, you explored basic charts like scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms using `matplotlib`. Today, you’ll learn how to create **interactive visualizations** using Plotly, a powerful tool for making your data come to life."

**Narrator (Voiceover):**  
"Plotly is an **interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library** for Python. It’s pre-installed in Google Colab, so you can start using it right away. If you’re working locally, you can install it using `pip install plotly`. Once installed, you can import Plotly Express (`px`) for quick visualizations or Plotly Graph Objects (`go`) for more advanced customization."

**Narrator (Voiceover):**  
"Let’s start with a **scatter plot**. Scatter plots are great for showing relationships between two numerical variables. With Plotly, you can create interactive scatter plots that let you **hover over points, zoom in, and toggle data on or off**. Here’s an example using a sample dataset. Notice how the points are colored based on their category, making it easy to spot patterns."

**Narrator (Voiceover):**  
"Next, let’s create a **line chart**. Line charts are perfect for showing trends over time. With Plotly, you can easily plot your data and interact with it. Here’s an example of a line chart showing sales data over several years. You can hover over the lines to see exact values and zoom in to explore specific time periods."

**Narrator (Voiceover):**  
"Finally, let’s create a **grouped bar chart**. Grouped bar charts are ideal for comparing multiple categories across different groups. With Plotly, you can customize the colors, group the bars, and make the chart interactive. Here’s an example comparing values across different groups and categories."

**[Closing Scene: Google Colab Notebook with the lesson’s key takeaways displayed.]**

**Narrator (Voiceover):**  
"By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to create **interactive scatter plots, line charts, and grouped bar charts** using Plotly. You’ll also learn how to customize your charts to make them more engaging and user-friendly. Ready to get started? Open the Colab notebook, follow along, and start experimenting with Plotly!"
